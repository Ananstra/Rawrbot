Rawrbot - An IRC Bot written in Ruby
By: Craig Meinschein
====================================

Rawrbot is a Ruby IRC bot which uses the Cinch IRC Bot 
framework. (https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch)

Functionality is based on plugins loaded into the bot. Plugins
can be written using Ruby and the Cinch API.

The original purpose of Rawrbot was to be a tool to assist Portland State
University's Office of Information Technology Help Desk technicians.
Many of the plugins I've written are specifically geared towards
that and are only useful for that purpose. Other plugins are more
generic or are simply for-fun.

REQUIREMENTS:
=============
  Rawrbot itself requires
    - Ruby v1.9.x, and
    - The 'Cinch' Ruby gem. 

    Individual plugins have their own requirements, which are listed
    at the top of the plugin file.

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION:
=============

- Clone the git repo.  

    `git clone git://github.com/pfaffle/Rawrbot.git`

- Edit the list of plugins to load (if desired) in rawrbot.rb.
    Specifically, edit the line that looks like this:

        config.plugins.plugins = [plugin1,plugin2,plugin3]
    
    Inside the square brackets should be a comma-separated list of the Class
    names of each plugin you wish to load when Rawrbot is started.

- Create and edit the config files.

    Samples are provided for the main rawrbot config file and config
  and authentication information files for the plugins. In each case,
    simply create a copy of the file with the same name, excluding the
  .sample extension, then edit it to your liking.

        `cp config.rb.sample config.rb`
        `vim config.rb` 

- Run the bot within screen or tmux.
        
        `./rawrbot.rb`

MODIFYING/ADDING PLUGINS
=============

If you want to create your own plugin for Rawrbot, simply
create a file named plugin_pluginname.rb in the 'plugins' directory
underneath the bot's installation directory. Use other plugins as
examples to work from when creating a new plugin.

Add your plugin's Class name to the comma-separated list of plugins
in rawrbot.rb if you want it to be automatically loaded when
the bot starts.

For more details, consult the Cinch documentation and see more examples
at Cinch's Github.com repo.
