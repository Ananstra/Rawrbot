Rawrbot - An IRC Bot written in Ruby
By: Craig Meinschein

Rawrbot is a Ruby IRC bot which uses the Cinch IRC Bot 
framework. (https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch)

Functionality is based on plugins loaded into the bot. Plugins
can be written using Ruby and the Cinch API.

The main purpose of Rawrbot is to assist in OIT Helpdesk-related
work. The FEATURES file contains a list of all current and planned
functionality. 

Requirements: 
	Currently, the bot must be run on an OIT or CAT UNIX machine in
	order to work properly. It relies on being in PSU's IP space
	to use its LDAP search, since OIT's LDAP server is firewalled
  off from off-campus entities.

	In addition, Rawrbot requires Ruby v1.9.x to be installed, as well
	as the following Ruby gems:
	- Cinch
	- Net-LDAP
	- GDBM
