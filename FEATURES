Currently working on:
----
	- Learning module:
x 	-- Add support for special reply syntax like <reply> and |
x 	-- Add support for literally displaying the entry.
x 	-- Add a help function.
	- Lunch break tracking.
	- Import old karma and learning database from the previous rawrbot.
	- Rate limiter for output, so we don't spam channels, and so it doesn't
		lag when returning a lot of data in a short time.
	- RT Ticket search.
	- Phone extension search.
	- Set user modes on Rawrbot.
	- "Issue of the day" tracking, which rawrbot will pm to people who join
	  #helpdesk.
	- "tumblr link aggregator or somesuch=)"
	  "oooo, give rawrbot a tumblr that records all links? shiny"

Known bugs:
----
	- Rawrbot respond to things like 'hello rawrbot' but not to 'rawrbot: hello'
