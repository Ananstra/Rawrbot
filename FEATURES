Currently working on:

	- Don't respond to spammed commands.
	- Lunch break tracking.
	- Import old karma and learning database from the previous rawrbot.
	- RT Ticket search.
	- Phone extension search.
	- Set user modes on Rawrbot.
	- "Issue of the day" tracking, which rawrbot will pm to people who join
	  #helpdesk.
	- "tumblr link aggregator or somesuch=)"
	  "oooo, give rawrbot a tumblr that records all links? shiny"
	- AD account search
	- Print quota lookup (http://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/ExternalDataSourceAPI option 7)

Known bugs:
----
	- Rawrbot respond to things like 'hello rawrbot' but not to 'rawrbot: hello'
	- Rawrbot fails to store information about things with 'i' or 's' in the key,
		rather than just things aside from the word (is).
